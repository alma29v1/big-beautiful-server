# üö® Incident Response Lead Generation

## Overview

The Incident Response tab monitors local police reports for fires, burglaries, and other security incidents, then automatically generates contact lists for addresses within a specified radius. This creates immediate business opportunities by reaching out to residents who may be concerned about safety after nearby incidents.

## Business Strategy

**Why This Works:**
- People are most security-conscious immediately after local incidents
- Neighbors want to protect themselves from similar threats
- Timing is crucial - strike while safety concerns are highest
- Professional, helpful approach builds trust and credibility

## How to Use

### 1. Search for Incidents
- **Date Range**: Select recent incidents (last 1-7 days for best results)
- **Incident Types**: Choose relevant incidents:
  - ‚úÖ **Fire** - Highest priority (property damage concerns)
  - ‚úÖ **Burglary** - Highest priority (security concerns)
  - ‚úÖ **Theft** - Medium priority (general safety)
  - ‚úÖ **Vandalism** - Medium priority (property protection)
  - ‚úÖ **Assault** - High priority (personal safety)

### 2. Set Contact Radius
- **Recommended**: 100 yards (default)
- **Aggressive**: 50 yards (higher priority contacts)
- **Broad**: 200+ yards (larger lead pool)

### 3. Generate Contact Lists
The system automatically:
- Finds all addresses within the specified radius
- Calculates exact distances from incident location  
- Assigns priority levels based on proximity and incident type
- Creates appropriate marketing messages for each incident type

### 4. Export Options

#### üì§ Send to BatchData
- Exports address list to CSV format
- Use BatchData to get contact information (names, emails, phones)
- Returns enriched data with property owner details

#### üéØ Send to ActiveKnocker

- Includes incident-specific tags and notes

## Sample Contact Data Export

"456 Pine Ave","Wilmington","burglary","78 yards","High","Security assessment"
"789 Elm Rd","Wilmington","theft","92 yards","Medium","Property protection"
```

## Best Practices

### Timing
- **Immediate**: Contact within 24-48 hours of incident
- **Follow-up**: Second contact 1 week later if no response
- **Seasonal**: Increase monitoring during high-crime periods

### Messaging
- **Lead with Safety**: Focus on protection, not sales
- **Be Helpful**: Offer free consultations and assessments  
- **Local Knowledge**: Reference specific incident location
- **Professional**: Position as security expert, not salesperson

### Prioritization
1. **High Priority**: Within 50 yards of fire/burglary
2. **Medium Priority**: 50-100 yards from serious incidents  
3. **Standard Priority**: 100+ yards or minor incidents
